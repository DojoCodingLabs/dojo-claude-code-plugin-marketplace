# Claude Code Waypoint

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.0.0-blue)](CHANGELOG.md)

**Never lose context again.** Strategic waypoints for persistent memory and intentional context management in Claude Code projects.

---

## The Problem

Working with AI on complex projects means:
- ❌ **Context resets** force you to start from scratch
- ❌ **Lost decisions** - no record of why choices were made
- ❌ **Forgotten progress** - can't remember what's done
- ❌ **Broken continuity** - every session feels like day one
- ❌ **Manual repetition** - explaining the same things over and over

## The Solution

Claude Code Waypoint creates **strategic checkpoints** throughout your project journey:

- ✅ **Resume in < 60 seconds** after any context reset
- ✅ **Persistent memory** across sessions, days, weeks
- ✅ **Auto-activating skills** provide the right context automatically
- ✅ **Decision logging** captures the "why" behind choices
- ✅ **Works beyond code** - planning, research, any long-running work

**Waypoints are navigation markers** that help you track progress, return to known points, and resume quickly from exactly where you left off.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Copy Claude Code Waypoint to your project:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/DojoCodingLabs/claude-code-waypoint

# Copy to your project
cp -r claude-code-waypoint/.claude /path/to/your/project/
cp -r claude-code-waypoint/plans /path/to/your/project/

# Set up hooks
cd /path/to/your/project/.claude/hooks
npm install && chmod +x *.sh
```

### Your First Waypoint

```bash
# Create a waypoint for a feature
/create-plan auth-implementation

# Work on your feature...
# Waypoint tracks context automatically

# Before taking a break
/update-context

# Resume later (even after context reset)
/resume auth-implementation
# → Back to work in < 60 seconds
```

**[→ Detailed Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md)**

## 🎯 Core Features

### 1. Persistent Memory System (PRIMARY)

The **3-file waypoint structure** captures everything:

```
plans/active/auth-implementation/
├── auth-implementation-plan.md      # Strategy (rarely changes)
├── auth-implementation-context.md   # Current state (updated frequently)
└── auth-implementation-tasks.md     # Actionable checklist (daily updates)
```

**What gets tracked:**
- **Decisions** - Why you chose specific approaches
- **Progress** - What's done, in progress, and pending
- **Blockers** - What's preventing progress
- **Next actions** - Specific file + function to work on
- **Key discoveries** - Important findings during work

**SESSION PROGRESS tracking** enables the < 60 second resume:

```markdown
## SESSION PROGRESS (2025-01-15 14:30)

### ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Task 1 done
- [x] Task 2 done

### 🟡 IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Task 3 (CURRENT)

### 🎯 NEXT ACTION
Edit src/auth/login.ts - implement validateCredentials()
```

**[→ Deep dive: Waypoint Pattern](WAYPOINT_PATTERN.md)**

### 2. Auto-Activation System (CRITICAL)

Skills auto-activate based on context - right knowledge at the right time:

```
User types: "Create a new plan for..."
    ↓
Hook analyzes: prompt keywords + active files
    ↓
Auto-suggests: context-persistence skill
    ↓
Claude gets: Perfect context automatically
```

**Key skills that auto-activate:**
- **memory-management** - When you need to remember preferences
- **context-persistence** - When working with waypoint files
- **plan-approval** - When making significant changes

**[→ Learn more: Auto-Activation System](.claude/hooks/AUTO_ACTIVATION.md)**

### 3. Commands for Waypoint Management

- `/create-plan [task]` - Create new waypoint (3-file structure)
- `/update-context` - Update waypoint before context reset
- `/resume [task]` - Resume from existing waypoint

### 4. Specialized Agents

Copy-and-use agents for common workflows:
- **scaffold-customizer** - Adapt skills to your tech stack
- **documentation-architect** - Generate comprehensive docs
- **code-architecture-reviewer** - Review code for consistency
- **refactor-planner** - Plan refactoring strategies
- **plan-reviewer** - Review development plans
- **web-research-specialist** - Research technical issues

## 📚 What's Included

### Core Skills (Memory & Context)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **memory-management** | Intentional memory tracking and preference learning |
| **context-persistence** | Waypoint pattern implementation |
| **plan-approval** | User control workflows for complex changes |

These work with **any tech stack** - they're methodology, not code.

### Example Scaffolds (Opinionated)

| Skill | Tech Stack |
|-------|------------|
| **frontend-dev-guidelines** | Next.js 14+ + React 19 + shadcn/ui |
| **backend-dev-guidelines** | Supabase + Edge Functions |

**Not using our stack?** Use the `scaffold-customizer` agent to adapt skills for your tech.

**[→ Customization guide](CUSTOMIZATION.md)**

### Skill Developer (Meta)

The **skill-developer** skill teaches you how to create custom skills with memory patterns.

Resume time: 45 seconds
```

### 📊 Business Planning

```
Project: Q1 strategy redesign
Waypoint tracks:
- Market research findings
- Stakeholder feedback
- Strategic options considered
- Resource allocation decisions
- Implementation timeline

Resume time: 30 seconds
```

### 🔬 Research Projects

```

## 🌟 Credits & Origin

This project packages the incredible work shared by **[diet103](https://github.com/diet103)** in their repository **[claude-code-infrastructure-showcase](https://github.com/diet103/claude-code-infrastructure-showcase)**.

### Original Inspiration

From the Reddit post: **["Claude Code is a Beast - Tips from 6 Months of Hardcore Use"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1h4riv1/claude_code_is_a_beast_tips_from_6_months_of/)**

### What We Did

Building on this foundation, we added our own twist and improvements:
- **Introduced the "Waypoint" metaphor** - Renamed "dev docs" to "waypoints"
- **Transformed into distributable package** - Proper repository structure
- **Enhanced documentation** - Created comprehensive guides
- **Improved organization** - Restructured as `plans/` directory
- **Positioned correctly** - Memory/context management as PRIMARY
- **Made it accessible** - Simple copy-paste installation

**Core credit** goes to **diet103** for the innovative infrastructure patterns and 6 months of real-world validation.

#[issue-number]
```

## Testing

### Testing Hook Changes

```bash
# Validate JSON syntax
cat .claude/skills/skill-rules.json | jq .
cat .claude/memory/preferences.json | jq .

# Test skill activation
echo '{"prompt":"test keyword"}' | \
  cd .claude/hooks && npx tsx skill-activation-prompt.ts

# Test in real project
# 1. Copy modified files to test project
# 2. Edit files that should trigger skills
# 3. Verify skills activate
# 4. Check content is correct
```

### Testing Skill Changes

```bash
# 1. Read the skill file in Claude Code
# 2. Try examples from the skill
# 3. Verify they work for your use case
# 4. Check for errors or unclear sections

# 2. Validate markdown
# No special tool needed - just readable content

# 3. Test cross-references
# If skill references other files, verify links work
```

### Testing Documentation Changes

```bash
# 1. Read your changes carefully
# 2. Check for clarity and accuracy
# 3. Verify all code examples work
# 4. Check all links are correct
# 5. Have someone else read it (different perspective)
```

## Documentation Changes

### Updating Existing Files

**Small updates** (typos, clarity, examples):
- Edit the file directly
- Clear commit message: "docs: clarify [section] in [file]"
- Simple PR, quick approval

**Large updates** (restructuring, new sections):
- File an issue first - discuss approach
- Get feedback on organization
- Make changes in branch
- Submit PR with rationale

### Adding New Documentation

**New doc files** (like this guide):

```bash
git checkout -b docs/new-topic

# Create file with clear structure:
# - Title
# - Overview
# - Content sections
# - Examples
# - Related docs

# Get feedback on outline first (file issue)
# Then write full content
# PR with context on why this doc is needed
```

**Documentation principles**:
- **Clear**: Assume reader doesn't know the topic
- **Examples**: Show not just tell
- **Links**: Reference related docs
- **Actionable**: Give readers something to do
- **Maintained**: Don't let docs get stale

## Creating Custom Skills

### Anatomy of a Skill Contribution

```

**Get feedback** before you write the whole thing.

### Implementation

# You've already customized:
# - .claude/skills/frontend-dev-guidelines/ → React-specific
# - .claude/skills/backend-dev-guidelines/ → Django-specific
# - .claude/skills/skill-rules.json → React + Django patterns
# - .claude/memory/preferences.json → Your conventions

# Document your scaffold
cat > SCAFFOLD_REACT_DJANGO.md << 'EOF'
# React + Django Scaffold

## What Changed
- Frontend: Updated for React 18 (not Next.js)
- Backend: Changed from Supabase Edge Functions to Django
- Database: Updated ORM examples

```

**PR Template**:
```markdown
# Scaffold: [Framework 1] + [Framework 2]

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: [framework + versions]
- Backend: [framework + versions]
- Database: [system + versions]

## What Changed
- [Skill 1: changes]

### Scaffold Maintenance

If your scaffold gets out of date:

```bash
# Update it
git checkout -b scaffold/react-django-update
# ... make changes
git commit -m "Update React + Django scaffold to React 19 + Django 5.0"
git push
```

The community benefits as it stays current!
